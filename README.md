# static-simulation
A Python simulation to demonstrate the observable effects of modifying the velocities of stars within an open cluster. Generates a cluster and field star population, applies velocity changes, and transforms to observable coordinates (RA, Dec, proper motion) to show how these changes would be seen from Earth.
